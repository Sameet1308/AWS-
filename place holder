The MicroStrategy (MSTR) dossier uses data from the QlikView utilization dashboard, which tracks user activity and usage statistics, not license statistics. We focus on the latest 4 months of data because Qlik licenses are automatically removed if a user doesn't log in or use the application for over 90 days. This ensures we analyze active users, providing the most relevant and current usage data.
