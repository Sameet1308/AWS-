Factors Affecting Memory ConsumptionNumber of Rows (R)Number of Attributes (A)Number of Metrics (M)Data Type Sizes (D)Processing Overhead (P)Simplified Memory Calculation FormulaThe memory consumption ( M ) can be approximated using the following formula:[ M = (R \times (A \times D_a + M \times D_m)) + P ]Where:( R ) = Number of rows in the cube( A ) = Number of attributes( M ) = Number of metrics( D_a ) = Average size of attribute data types (in bytes)( D_m ) = Average size of metric data types (in bytes)( P ) = Processing overhead (additional memory required for processing)
