Reducing QlikView Licenses by Identifying High Impact ApplicationsObjectiveThe objective of this analysis is to identify applications with the highest number of unique users to effectively reduce QlikView licenses. By converting these applications to an alternative platform, we can significantly reduce licensing costs.DefinitionsUnique Users: Users who have access to only one specific application. These users do not use any other applications. Identifying applications with high numbers of unique users can help prioritize which applications to convert first, as converting these will directly reduce the number of licenses.Multi-App Users: Users who have access to the specific application as well as other applications. These users are more complex to handle since converting one application does not eliminate the need for other licenses they hold.MethodologyThe following algorithm is used to process the data and generate insights:Load Data: Load the user_applications table containing user access data with columns: user, app_name, year, and month.Filter for the Latest 4 Months:Determine the latest 4 months based on the year and month columns.Filter the data to include only entries from these latest 4 months.Reason: Qlik licenses are automatically removed if the user doesn't log in or use the application for more than 90 days. Therefore, considering the latest 4 months ensures that we are analyzing active users who have recently accessed the applications.
